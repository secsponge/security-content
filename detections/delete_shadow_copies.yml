description: The vssadmin.exe utility is used to interact with the Volume Shadow Copy
  Service.  Wmic is an interface to the Windows Management Instrumentation.  This
  search looks for either of these tools being used to delete shadow copies.

eli5: This search looks for execution of vssadmin or wmic with both the "delete" and
  "shadows" parameters passed on the command-line. The two arguments are searched
  for separately because we can't predict the number of spaces between the words on
  the command-line. The search will return the number of times this activity was observed,
  and the times of the first and last event.

how_to_implement: You must be ingesting endpoint data that tracks process activity,
  including parent-child relationships from your endpoints to populate the Endpoint
  data model in the Processes node. The command-line arguments are mapped to the "process"
  field in the Endpoint data model.

known_false_positives: vssadmin.exe and wmic.exe are standard applications shipped
  with modern versions of windows. They may be used by administrators to legitimately
  delete old backup copies, although this is typically rare.
